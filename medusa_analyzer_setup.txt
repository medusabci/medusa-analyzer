How to Set Up Medusa Analyzer

To get Medusa Analyzer up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Medusa Analyzer repository
First, clone the main branch of Medusa Analyzer onto your computer:
	git clone -b main https://github.com/medusabci/medusa-analyzer.git

2. Download the Medusa Kernel (Analyzer branch)
Medusa Analyzer requires the analyzer branch of the Medusa Kernel. Go to: https://github.com/medusabci/medusa-kernel.git
and download/checkout the developers_analyzer branch:
	git clone -b developers_analyzer https://github.com/medusabci/medusa-kernel.git


3. Set up a Python virtual environment
Create a virtual environment using Python 3.13 inside your Analyzer project:
	cd medusa-analyzer
	python3.13 -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
	venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows


4. Install the Medusa Kernel
Install the Medusa Kernel into your virtual environment by pointing pip to the kernel folder you just downloaded. For example:
	pip install /path/to/medusa-kernel
	(Replace /path/to/medusa-kernel with the actual path on your computer, e.g. /Users/john/projects/medusa-kernel/.)
